        James Shields struggles as Royals lose 6-3 to A?s <
        /2013/03/12/4116457/james-shields-struggles-as-royals.html>

    James Shields breezed through the first three innings against the
    Oakland A?s on Tuesday, retiring all nine batters, he faced
    including four on strikeouts. Then Shields started laboring, and the
    game slipped away. The A?s went on to beat the Royals 6-3.

        Royals want to ensure Lamb doesn?t rush comeback <
        /2013/03/12/4116427/royals-want-to-ensure-lamb-doesnt.html>

    If it wasn?t clear before, the Royals left no doubt Tuesday that
    they view this year as one for left-handed pitcher John Lamb to
    re-establish himself as a potential cornerstone for future
    rotations. Nothing more. While Lamb was optioned to Class AA
    Northwest Arkansas, there is no guarantee that he will open the
    season at that level.

    This St. Patrick?s Day, consider pouring a perfect pint of frothy,
    velvety black Guinness beer ? and then dumping it in the beef stew
    simmering away on your stove. Incorporating the famous Irish stout
    into recipes is surprisingly popular ? go online and you?ll find
    recipes for bread, chili, chocolate cake, even ice cream made with
    Guinness.

        Could jumping jacks become Missouri?s official state exercise? <
        /2013/03/11/4113961/could-jumping-jacks-become-missouris.html>

    Missouri elementary kids want state lawmakers to declare jumping
    jacks the official state exercise. The move would honor John J.
    Pershing, the homegrown war hero who is credited with inventing the
    exercise, and maybe even get Missourians in better shape.

        ?Slashdance!? delivers noise, laughs and some very good dancing
        < /2013/03/12/4116425/slashdance-delivers-noise-laughs.html>

    Campy movie parodies are essentially one-joke shows. If it?s a joke
    you like, then you?ll probably have a good time. Ron Megee?s
    ?Slashdance!? splices elements of ?Flashdance? to a tale about
    survivors in Kansas City fighting to keep a horde of cannibals at bay.

What we think of as the 1960s ? freedom movements, protests, an
explosion of creativity in the arts ? actually extended well into the
1970s before petering out about the time Jimmy Carter was elected.

The Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre is revisiting the era with a dramatic
work that still packs a punch. Ntozake Shange?s 1976 play ?For Colored
Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf? feels firmly
rooted in its era, although the feminist issues Shange talks about are
every bit as relevant now as they were a generation ago.

Shange has updated the material to include a section on AIDS and has
replaced Vietnam with Iraq/Afghanistan in reflecting the social cost of
a protracted war. The changes are pretty seamless, although they don?t
really do much to enhance the work?s relevance.

Described as a ?choreopoem? by Shange, the extended one-act compresses
about 20 verse pieces into its running time. There are no conventional
characters and no conventional plot. The show is performed by seven
actresses identified only by colors ? the Lady in Green, the Lady in
Red, and so on ? who enunciate poetic passages that don?t directly
relate to one another.

There is thematic unity, however. One has to do with the bond of
African-American women based on their collective experience. The other
throws into sharp relief the exploitation and abuse of women by men.

That?s not to say the play is a downer. Shange weaves quite a bit of
honest humor into the script. She also pulls back at moments to allow us
a sense of historical perspective. A passage describing a Creole
carnival in Natchez, Miss., vividly captures a moment in time brought to
life by Shange?s muscular and richly visual language.

Director Karen Paisley has put together a gifted cast and stages the
piece with choices that, for the most part, capture the power and
meaning of Shange?s language. Shannon Smith-Regnier?s costumes are
simple but vivid, and the show is enhanced inestimably by Greg
Casparian?s lighting design.

I?ve seen some but not all of these performers, who generally bring
specificity and controlled emotional power to the show.

Chioma Anyanwu, Victoria Barbee, Donette Coleman, Aishah Harvey, Lynn
King, Sherri Roulette Mosley and Meredith Wolfe represent various ages
and physical types, but their evident joy of working with one another
other comes through clearly.

Each performer has memorable moments, but Mosley as the Lady in Red
creates indelible images with her emotional enactment of a passage late
in the show about a mother dealing with the violent man in her life ? a
war veteran and crack addict.

The challenges faced by the women onstage are sometimes harsh, always
difficult and depressingly eternal. Ultimately, however, the ladies of
color find a bit of grace as they chant the refrain; ?I found God in
myself and I love her fiercely.?

It?s a moment of uplift that allows the play to conclude on a hopeful note.
